* This can be very useful in dashboards and reports for providing insights into the relative contribution of different segments to the overall performance.

* By understanding the percentage contributions, we can make informed decisions based on which segments are driving the most sales and which ones may need more attention or improvement.

Example: If Region A has 200 orders and the total orders from all regions are 1000, the % of All Orders for Region A is 20%. This tells us that Region A contributes 20% to the overall sales.
