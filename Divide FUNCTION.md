# Divide Function

+ Ideal to perform divisions, when you want to avoid errors occur by dividing by zero.
+ If the denominator is zero or blank, instead of causing an error, DIVIDE returns an alternative result (if specified) or BLANK().
## SafetyDivision = DIVIDE(10, 0, "Division by zero error")


## Week-day/end % Difference = DIVIDE([Total Weekday Trips] - [Total Weekend Trips], [Total Weekend Trips]) * 100
